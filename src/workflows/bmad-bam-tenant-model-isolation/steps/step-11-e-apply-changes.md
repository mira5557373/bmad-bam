# Step 11: Apply Targeted Modifications

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- 🛑 **NEVER generate content without user input** - Wait for explicit direction
- 📖 **CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file** before taking any action
- 🔄 **CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C'**, ensure entire file is read
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS pause after presenting findings** and await user direction
- 🎯 **Focus ONLY on current step scope** - do not look ahead

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 💾 Update document frontmatter after each section completion
- 📝 Maintain append-only document building
- ✅ Track progress in `stepsCompleted` array

---

## Purpose

This step applies the identified changes to the existing tenant model and isolation matrix artifacts. Changes are applied incrementally while preserving document structure, unaffected asset types, context propagation rules, and ensuring no implicit sharing of tenant data is introduced.

---

## Prerequisites

- Step 10 completed with identified changes
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv → filter: tenant-isolation`

---


## Inputs

- Loaded artifact from previous edit step
- Identified modification targets
- User-confirmed changes to apply
- Pattern registry: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv`

---

## Actions

Based on the user's requested changes:

1. Identify the affected sections in the tenant model / isolation matrix documents
2. Present the current content of each affected section
3. Apply the requested modifications while preserving:
   - Document structure
   - Unaffected asset types in the isolation matrix
   - Context propagation rules for unaffected boundaries
4. If modifying the isolation strategy for an asset type, verify:
   - No implicit sharing of tenant data is introduced
   - Context propagation still covers the affected boundary
   - Compliance requirements are still met
5. Validate the modified documents against completeness criteria
6. Write updated documents back to their original locations

Present a diff summary of changes made and ask for confirmation.

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

After applying changes, present the user with:

```
Your options:
- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Deep dive into change impact and validation
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring analyst and architect perspectives for change review
- **C (Continue)**: Accept changes and finalize tenant model update
- **[Specific refinements]**: Describe what you'd like to explore further

Select an option:
```

### PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):
- Invoke the `bmad-advanced-elicitation` skill
- Pass change context: modifications applied, impact analysis
- Process enhanced insights from deep questioning
- Ask user: "Accept these enhanced findings? (y/n)"
- If yes, integrate into change validation
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):
- Invoke the `bmad-party-mode` skill
- Context: "Review tenant model changes: {summary of modifications and impact}"
- Process collaborative analysis from analyst and architect personas
- Present synthesized recommendations
- Ask user: "Accept these recommendations? (y/n)"
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):
- Save updated tenant model and isolation matrix
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [10, 11]`
- Suggest validation mode if significant changes

---

## Verification

- [ ] Changes identified correctly
- [ ] No unintended side effects
- [ ] Patterns align with pattern registry
- [ ] No implicit sharing of tenant data introduced
- [ ] Compliance requirements still met

---

## Outputs

- Updated tenant model document
- Updated tenant isolation matrix (if affected)

---

## Next Step

Run tenant isolation validation (QG-M2) to verify changes against isolation requirements.
