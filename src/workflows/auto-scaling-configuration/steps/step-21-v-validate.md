# Step 21: Validate Auto-Scaling Configuration

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- NEVER generate content without user input - Wait for explicit direction
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- ALWAYS pause after presenting findings and await user direction
- Focus ONLY on current step scope - do not look ahead

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- Show your analysis before taking any action
- Update document frontmatter after each section completion
- Maintain append-only document building
- Track progress in `stepsCompleted` array

---

## Purpose

Validate the auto-scaling configuration artifact against quality criteria and infrastructure standards for multi-tenant SaaS platforms.

---

## Prerequisites

- Previous step completed (step-20-v-load-artifact.md)
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv` -> filter: `auto-scaling`
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv` -> filter: `infrastructure`

---

## Inputs

- Loaded artifact from validation step 20
- Quality gate criteria and checklist
- Pattern registry for validation rules
- Previous validation findings (if re-validating)

---

## Actions

### 1. Load Artifact

- Read the artifact from `{output_folder}/` specified location
- Parse and validate structure

### 2. Validate Content

- Check all required sections are present
- Verify cross-references are valid
- Validate against quality gate checklist

### 3. Generate Findings

- Document any issues found
- Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

---

## Verification

### Scaling Metrics
- [ ] Core metrics defined with thresholds
- [ ] AI workload metrics specified
- [ ] Composite scaling rules documented
- [ ] Cooldown periods appropriate

### Policy Design
- [ ] Web/API policies defined
- [ ] AI inference policies configured
- [ ] Background job policies specified
- [ ] Min/max appropriate per workload

### Tenant Fairness
- [ ] Resource quotas defined per tier
- [ ] Burst capacity configured
- [ ] Noisy neighbor detection implemented
- [ ] Priority queuing specified

### Cost Controls
- [ ] Spot instance strategy defined
- [ ] Reserved capacity planned
- [ ] Scale-to-zero configured
- [ ] Budget alerts specified

---

## Gate Decision

- **PASS**: All sections complete, metrics appropriate, cost controls configured
- **CONDITIONAL**: Minor gaps - document gaps and proceed
- **FAIL**: Missing critical sections - return to Create mode

---

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

After completing validation checks, present the user with:

```
Your options:
- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Deep dive into validation findings and edge cases
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring analyst and architect perspectives for validation review
- **C (Continue)**: Accept validation results and proceed to generate report
- **[Specific refinements]**: Describe what you'd like to explore further

Select an option:
```

### PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):
- Invoke the `bmad-advanced-elicitation` skill
- Pass validation context: findings, gate decision, gaps identified
- Process enhanced insights from deep questioning
- Ask user: "Accept these enhanced findings? (y/n)"
- If yes, integrate into validation results
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):
- Invoke the `bmad-party-mode` skill
- Context: "Review auto-scaling validation: {summary of findings and gate decision}"
- Process collaborative analysis from analyst and architect personas
- Present synthesized recommendations
- Ask user: "Accept these recommendations? (y/n)"
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):
- Save validation results
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [20, 21]`
- Proceed to next step: `step-22-v-generate-report.md`

---

## Outputs

- Validation report with findings
- Gate decision with rationale
- Remediation recommendations (if CONDITIONAL or FAIL)

---

## Next Step

Proceed to `step-22-v-generate-report.md` to generate the validation report.
