# Step 20: Load Artifact

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- NEVER generate content without user input - Wait for explicit direction
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- ALWAYS pause after presenting findings and await user direction
- Focus ONLY on current step scope - do not look ahead

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- Show your analysis before taking any action
- Update document frontmatter after each section completion
- Maintain append-only document building
- Track progress in `stepsCompleted` array

---

## Purpose

Load the Auto-Scaling Configuration artifact for validation. This document defines the infrastructure scaling behavior including metrics, policies, tenant fairness controls, and cost optimization strategies.

---

## Prerequisites

- Previous step completed (workflow selection)
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv` -> filter: `auto-scaling`
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv` -> filter: `infrastructure`

---

## Inputs

- Artifact file path for validation
- Quality gate checklist: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/checklists/`
- Pattern registry: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv`

---

## Actions

### 1. Load Artifact

Read from `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/infrastructure/auto-scaling-configuration.md`

### 2. Validate Content

Check all required sections are present.

---

## Expected Artifact Structure

The auto-scaling-configuration.md should contain:
- Scaling Metrics with thresholds
- Policy Design per workload
- Tenant Fairness with quotas
- Cost Controls with budget alerts

---

## Error Handling Guidance

If the file does not exist, inform the user that there is no artifact to validate and suggest switching to Create mode.

---

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

After loading the artifacts, present the user with:

```
Your options:
- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Deep dive into document structure and completeness
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring analyst and architect perspectives for initial review
- **C (Continue)**: Proceed to detailed validation checks
- **[Specific refinements]**: Describe what you'd like to explore further

Select an option:
```

### PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):
- Invoke the `bmad-advanced-elicitation` skill
- Pass document context: sections present, initial structure assessment
- Process enhanced insights from deep questioning
- Ask user: "Accept these enhanced findings? (y/n)"
- If yes, integrate into validation preparation
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):
- Invoke the `bmad-party-mode` skill
- Context: "Review auto-scaling configuration structure: {summary of sections and completeness}"
- Process collaborative analysis from analyst and architect personas
- Present synthesized recommendations
- Ask user: "Accept these recommendations? (y/n)"
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):
- Confirm document loaded successfully
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [20]`
- Proceed to next step: `step-21-v-validate.md`

---

## Verification

- [ ] Artifact loaded successfully
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Patterns align with pattern registry

---

## Outputs

- Loaded artifact for validation
- Validation checklist

---

## Next Step

Proceed to `step-21-v-validate.md` for detailed validation checks.
