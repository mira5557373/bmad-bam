# Step 20: Load Artifact

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- **NEVER generate content without user input** - Wait for explicit direction
- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file** before taking any action
- **CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C'**, ensure entire file is read
- **ALWAYS pause after presenting findings** and await user direction
- **Focus ONLY on current step scope** - do not look ahead

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- Show your analysis before taking any action
- Update document frontmatter after each section completion
- Maintain append-only document building
- Track progress in `stepsCompleted` array

---

## Purpose

This step loads the Tenant Portal Design artifacts for validation. These documents define the self-service capabilities, admin features, tier-specific options, billing integration, and information architecture.

---

## Prerequisites

- Tenant portal design has been executed (Create mode completed)
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv` -> filter: `customization`



---

## Inputs

- Artifact file path for validation
- Quality gate checklist: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/checklists/`
- Pattern registry: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv`

---

## Actions

### 1. Load Artifact

- Read the artifact from `{output_folder}/` specified location
- Parse and validate structure
- Verify document integrity

### 2. Validate Content

- Check all required sections are present
- Verify cross-references are valid
- Validate against quality gate checklist

### 3. Generate Findings

- Document any issues found
- Categorize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

---

---

## Artifact Locations

Load the existing tenant portal documents:
- `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/ux/tenant-portal-design.md`
- `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/ux/portal-information-architecture.md`

---

## Pre-Validation Checks

Before proceeding, verify the following conditions for each file:
- Both files exist at their specified paths
- Files are readable and contain valid markdown
- Feature definitions are complete
- References between design and IA are consistent

---

## Expected Artifact Structure

The tenant-portal-design.md should contain:
- Self-service capability catalog
- Admin feature catalog
- Tier feature matrix
- Billing integration specification
- Wireframe descriptions

The portal-information-architecture.md should contain:
- Navigation structure
- Page hierarchy
- Feature-to-page mapping
- Mobile considerations

---

## Error Handling Guidance

If the files do not exist, inform the user that there is no artifact to validate and suggest switching to Create mode.

If one file exists but the other is missing, report which file is absent and note that complete portal validation requires both the design document and the information architecture.

---

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

After loading the artifacts, present the user with:

```
Your options:
- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Deep dive into document structure and completeness
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring analyst and architect perspectives for initial review
- **C (Continue)**: Proceed to detailed validation checks
- **[Specific refinements]**: Describe what you'd like to explore further

Select an option:
```

### PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):
- Invoke the `bmad-advanced-elicitation` skill
- Pass document context: sections present, initial structure assessment
- Process enhanced insights from deep questioning
- Ask user: "Accept these enhanced findings? (y/n)"
- If yes, integrate into validation preparation
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):
- Invoke the `bmad-party-mode` skill
- Context: "Review portal structure: {summary of sections and completeness}"
- Process collaborative analysis from analyst and architect personas
- Present synthesized recommendations
- Ask user: "Accept these recommendations? (y/n)"
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):
- Confirm documents loaded successfully
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [20]`
- Proceed to next step: `step-21-v-validate.md`

---

## Verification

- [ ] Artifact loaded successfully
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Document structure matches expected format
- [ ] No placeholder content remaining
- [ ] Patterns align with pattern registry

---

## Outputs

- Loaded artifact ready for validation

---

## Next Step

Once both artifacts are successfully loaded and initial structure is confirmed, proceed to Step 21: Validate Artifact to perform detailed quality criteria checks.
