# Step 10: Load Existing Artifact

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST)

- 🛑 **NEVER generate content without user input** - Wait for explicit direction
- 📖 **CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file** before taking any action
- 🔄 **CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C'**, ensure entire file is read
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS pause after presenting findings** and await user direction
- 🎯 **Focus ONLY on current step scope** - do not look ahead

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- 💾 Update document frontmatter after each section completion
- 📝 Maintain append-only document building
- ✅ Track progress in `stepsCompleted` array

---

## Purpose

This step loads the existing distributed tracing design document for modification. Edit mode allows updates to the OpenTelemetry configuration, context propagation, tenant correlation, or sampling strategies without recreating the entire design from scratch.

---

## Prerequisites

- Existing distributed tracing design document to modify
- **Load patterns:** `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv -> filter: observability`

---


## Inputs

- Existing artifact file path
- User-specified modifications or update requirements
- Pattern registry: `{project-root}/_bmad/bam/data/bam-patterns.csv`

---

## Actions

### 1. Load Artifacts

Load the existing distributed tracing design document:
- `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/architecture/distributed-tracing-design.md`

If the file does not exist, inform the user and suggest switching to Create mode.

### 2. Parse Document Structure

Parse and display a summary of the current document:
- OpenTelemetry SDK configuration
- Trace exporter selection
- Context propagation boundaries covered
- Tenant correlation attributes
- Sampling strategies by tier

### 3. Confirm Modification Targets

Confirm with the user which sections need modification.

---

## COLLABORATION MENUS (A/P/C):

After loading and parsing the artifacts, present the user with:

```
Your options:
- **A (Advanced Elicitation)**: Deep dive into modification requirements and impact analysis
- **P (Party Mode)**: Bring analyst and architect perspectives for change review
- **C (Continue)**: Proceed to apply identified modifications
- **[Specific refinements]**: Describe what you'd like to explore further

Select an option:
```

### PROTOCOL INTEGRATION:

#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):
- Invoke the `bmad-advanced-elicitation` skill
- Pass artifact context: current state, proposed changes
- Process enhanced insights from deep questioning
- Ask user: "Accept these enhanced findings? (y/n)"
- If yes, integrate into modification scope
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'P' (Party Mode):
- Invoke the `bmad-party-mode` skill
- Context: "Review distributed tracing modification: {summary of current state and proposed changes}"
- Process collaborative analysis from analyst and architect personas
- Present synthesized recommendations
- Ask user: "Accept these recommendations? (y/n)"
- Return to A/P/C menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):
- Confirm modification targets with user
- Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [10]`
- Proceed to next step: `step-11-e-apply-changes.md`

---

## Verification

- [ ] Existing artifacts loaded successfully
- [ ] Document structure parsed correctly
- [ ] Modification scope confirmed with user
- [ ] Patterns align with pattern registry

---

## Outputs

- Summary of current distributed tracing configuration
- Confirmed list of sections to modify

---

## Next Step

Proceed to `step-11-e-apply-changes.md` with identified modification targets.
